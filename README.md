# Lending Club Case Study
> Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

## General Information
- If we are able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
- In this case study, we will perform EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
- Understanding driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Conclusions
- Loan offering is on positive trend as the company is moving in right direction.
- Mortgage and Rent ownership individuals are likely to take more loans and the risk to default is almost 10-15%.
- California people tend to take more loans, but we see there is almost ~15% Default rate.
- Extra screening for loan approval for 10+ years to be initiated as we see the default rate can increase.
- Low Grade loans are more likely to get defaulted (Interest rate to be increased)
